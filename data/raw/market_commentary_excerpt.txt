Market Outlook. Inflation moderated compared to prior peaks but remains above central bank targets. Policy makers indicated a data-dependent approach to future rate decisions. Labor markets show signs of gradual cooling, and supply chains continue to normalize. We expect volatility to persist as markets digest earnings and macroeconomic developments.

Sector Views. We view high quality balance sheets favorably in an environment of elevated rates and slower growth. Pricing power and cash flow resilience remain key differentiators.
