Item 1A. Risk Factors. Our business is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could materially affect our financial condition and results of operations. These risks include increased competition, regulatory changes, cybersecurity incidents, supply chain disruptions, and macroeconomic factors such as inflation and interest rate volatility. We may also face compliance risks related to evolving data privacy requirements. Investors should carefully consider these risk factors, as well as the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Managementâ€™s Discussion and Analysis. Inflationary pressures during the fiscal year resulted in higher input costs. We implemented selective price increases and cost control initiatives. Interest rate movements influenced customer demand for certain financing products, while our liquidity position remained strong.
